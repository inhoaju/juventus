        <h3>Foundation</h3>
        <p>Juventus were founded as Sport-Club Juventus in late 1897 by pupils from the Massimo D'Azeglio Lyceum school in Turin, among them the brothers Eugenio and Enrico Canfari, but were renamed as Foot-Ball Club Juventus two years later.</p>
        <p>The club joined the Italian Football Championship in 1900. In 1904, the businessman Ajmone-Marsan revived the finances of the football club Juventus, making it also possible to transfer the training field from piazza d'armi to the more appropriate Velodrome Umberto I. During this period, the team wore a pink and black kit.</p>
        <p>Juventus first won the leagu championship in 1905 while playing at their Velodrom Umberto I ground. By this time the club colours had changed to black and white stripes, inspired by English side Notts County.</p>
        <p>There was a split at the club in 1906, after some of the staff considered moving Juve out of Turin. President Alfred Dick was unhappy with this and left with some prominent players to found FBC Torino which in turn spawned the <em>Derby della Mole</em>. Juventus spent much of this period steadily rebuilding after the split, surviving the First World War.</p>
