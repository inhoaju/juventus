          <h3>Return of the King</h3>
          <p>After <em>Calciopoli</em> scandal and Juve relegated to Serie B in 2006-2007 season, the team returned to Serie A in 2007-2008 season. Juventus appointed Claudio Ranieri as manager. The team finished in third place in the first season and qualified for the Champions League third qualifying round in the preliminary stages.</p>
          <p>Juventus reached the group stages, where they beat Real Madrid in both home and away legs, before losing in the knockout round to Chelsea. Ranieri was sacked following a string of unsuccessful results and Ciro Ferrara was appointed as manage on a temporary basis for the last two games of the 2008-2009 season, before being subsequently appointed as the manager for the 2009-2010 season. </p>
          <p>Ferrara's stint as Juventus manager, however, proved to be unsuccessful, with Juvetus knocked out of Champions League and Coppa Italia, as well as just lying on the sixth place in the league table at the end of January 2010, leading to the dismissal of Ferrara and the naming of Alberto Zaccheroni as caretaker manager. Zaccheroni could not help the side improve, as Juventus finished the season in seventh place in Serie A.</p>
          <p>For the 2010-2011 season, Jean-Claude Blanc was replaced by Andrea Agnelli as the club's president. Agnelli's first action was to replace Zaccheroni and director of sport Alessio Secco with Sampdoria manager Luigi Delneri and director of sport Giuseppe Marotta. However, Delneri failed to improve their fortunes and was dismissed. Former player and fan favourite Antonio Conte, fresh after winning promotion with Siena, was named as Delneri's replacement. In September 2011, Juventus relocated to the new Juventus Stadium.</p>
